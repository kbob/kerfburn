# There Is Much To Do.

Is this a bug database?


## Next!

* Wire up back panel, power distribution, and relays.


## Design

* Need a list of fault  states.  In particular, need fault states when
  we  fail to move  off the  limit switches.   If you  move 1  cm, and
  you're still on the switch, the switch must be disconnected/broken.

  Also need to think about how faults are stored and reported.


## Testing

+ Set up a backend test harness.

* Test all kinds of soft interrupt delivery.


## Documentation

* Document the build system?

* Coding style document?

* Pull the hardware section out of the architecture section and make
  it a standalone document.

* Document the status reporting variables.


## Coding

* The Makefiles need a lot of refactoring.

* `make clean` should clean up `tools/bin` and `config` subdirectories.

* Write a curses-based status report tool.


### Configuration

* Should auto-generate the home sequence from the geometry config.


### Back End

* Severe bug: if the laser is in in continuous firing mode, when the
  engine stops, the laser turns on.
  
* Use a higher baud rate than 9600.  See comments in `ftdi_sio.c` near
  line 1122 (in the Linux kernel source tree).  Also see
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3192478/specifying-non-standard-baud-rate-for-ftdi-virtual-serial-port-under-linux

* Change serial driver so most functions are in-line.

* Define pin mapping function for PCINTn pins.  Define e-stop and lid
  as PCINT pins.  Write driver/interrupt handler for them.

* Redefine some terminology.  An "atom" is a 16 bit item that the motor
  ISRs consume.  An "interval" is an atom that describe how long to
  wait.  A "verb" is an atom that says to do something other than wait
  for an interval.
  
  Use this terminology in the code.

  "Verb" is a silly word.  How about directive?  Special?   

* Add a command to set the laser power.  I don't think it can be enqueued.

* I need to move the engine to the soft interrupt.


### Thruport

* See double fork comments in `front/thruport/daemon.c`.

* Make the client commands auto-start the daemon if it is not running.

* Redesign the error reporting/logging facility.

* I don't know whether the daemon shuts itself down cleanly on errors.
  It uses `atexit()` but I haven't seen that work.

* Make the data paths 8-bit clean.  Currently, NUL characters are not
  transmitted, as well as characters `'\xF0'` through `'\xFF'`.

* Write some error handling/reporting utilities.  Make sure all client
  errors go to `stderr` and all daemon errors go to syslog.  Make the
  messages more consistent and user-centric.  The utilities should also
  prepend "thruport: " to stderr messages.

* In `main.c`, refactor usage messages into fields in the action
  structure.  (And rename `action` since it won't be appropriate any
  more.)

* In `main.c`, decide what the default action should be, and implement
  that.

* Implement highlighting in `*_repr()`.

* Implement control mode.  What controls do we need?

* Implement a `send --force` mode to replace the current sender.

* In `receiver_service.c`, the receiver array needs locking.  There is
  a race condition and probable crash waiting to happen there.


### GCode Interpreter

* Add arc support.

* Find out why it is so slow and make it faster.


## Cleanup

* Use `sig_atomic_t` where appropriate.

* Standardize filenames on "\_" or "-" separators.  I think I prefer
  "-" for C, but Python requires "\_".

* Keep the config. directory clean.  Put the template files and the
  generated files somewhere else (probably in back/).  Only
  user-created config files (and maybe a README) should be in config/.


## Hardware

* Wire up E-Stop switch.

* Wire up lid switch.

* Install the temporary back panel.

* Wire up relays to Azteeg and wire up power lines to back panel.

* Replace wrong-size screws on limit switches and cable carrier with
  right-size.

* Connect ATX power-ready pin to Azteeg.

* Affix heat sinks to stepper drivers and adjust the current to max.
  (Defer until motor control is debugged.  There will be many crashes
  before that.)

* Add a limit switch for Y max.

* Wire up Z limit switches.

* Test and connect Z motor.

* Drill out carriage plate to pass air fitting through.
